# Current issues

> * I accidentally uploaded 100 separate entry files to the root of the update_log folder, when they should have been uploaded to the root of the entries folder. I don't know how to mass move files at the moment, and I am not willing to spend hours moving 100 files one by one, when there is a working method out there. 

> * The file is really bloated

> * The file is out of date and needs updates
