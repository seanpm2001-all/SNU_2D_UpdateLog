A major issue came up today that will really hinder site development. I wrote an article about it The Apple purchase of the iframe element I want to keep SNU open source, but I am worried about what Apple plans to do with this crucially important tag. I am going to have to pay a fine to even use it License cost of an apple iframe license is $99 I honestly can't believe this, they have received so much criticism for this, as so many people are currently using the tag, that they took the page down. Now there is no way to pay your iFee! Someone needs to get together and get a tag that can't be branded by a current company. So that is why development will be starting on the wwwframe project. I don't have the capacity to work on it yet, so I outsourced it to the Knome foundation, as GNOME and KDE have come together to fix things today. It should be ready in a few weeks, then Apple will be screwed! This is the longest entry I have ever done. I don't know if anyone is going to buy this tnih tnih (:
