Developer log entry for today: view it here (developer log day 445)

I didn't have any time with my Linux machines today (other than my phone) and I was really unfocused. I read a lot of Wikipedia and got sidetracked frequently. I had to work a little later in my afternoon session due to this. The video player receives its final translation update for now, I translated every language that I could, and left placeholder text for those I couldn't translate. I finally have a good concept for the video resolution options, so I added a demo of that today. Along with this, I did the usual documentation changes, and created 10 more separate update log and developer log entry pages, as part of the new project of creating pages for every day I have created a developer log, and or update log post.

Tomorrow is the 21st anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting, this year there won't be any copycat shootings, since schools are closed around the world. It is a horrible anniversary. I didn't do anything else with site development today. I got an answer to the color question for the BSoD project, but unfortunately, he isn't a web developer, so he didn't know how to better span the text.
