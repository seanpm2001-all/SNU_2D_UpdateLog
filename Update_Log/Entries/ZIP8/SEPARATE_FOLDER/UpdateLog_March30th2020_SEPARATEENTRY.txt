Developer log entry for today: view it here (developer log day 425)

I have had really bad time management lately, and it was difficult getting to work today. When I got to work, I came up with some stuff to do. I did a lot today with the time I had. I worked on documentation (as usual) a brief update to the SNU News system, a massive update to the SNU Internet Museum, getting the system ready to get all the old content back, and a syntax maintenance update to the original SNU internet legends page.

I was a bit nauseous when I started working, but it got better overtime. I will continue work on the Internet Museum tomorrow, as there isn't much else for me to do at the moment. I originally was just going to do a documentation only update today, but I was able to do more than that in the end. I am hoping to get some outside help on the site soon, as I am resorting to modifying older pages again.
