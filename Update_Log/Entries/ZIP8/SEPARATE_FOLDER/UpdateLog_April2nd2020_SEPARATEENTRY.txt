Developer log entry for today: view it here (developer log day 428)

I wrote a "hidden" comment yesterday about my issues lately and how they benefited the April Fools joke. They actually did. I have been having ongoing severe issues with tension for 3 days now, the first 2 days were intolerable for work. I have had issues with jaw tension my whole life, and I have taken medications for it. There is currently an issue with hypertension that I am working out, but it was good enough today to let me actually work on my website. I had more time to work on it as well, and the sun is finally shining outside again today (it has been hailing and raining a lot lately)

I was going to work on the Internet Museum more today, but I had some other projects I wanted to work on. I thought I started a 3D printing part of the site, but it turns out, I didn't. So today, I added in a 3D printing center to the site, and a place to make puzzles, as VLC has the option, but SNU needs its own puzzle system. I also did the usual documentation, with preparation for the week 61 article to be exported, and also I worked on a few pages on the SNU Internet Museum. Today was a comeback day from 2 days of failure after hypertension in my jaw stopped me dead in my tracks. I hope to continue development strong again tomorrow.
