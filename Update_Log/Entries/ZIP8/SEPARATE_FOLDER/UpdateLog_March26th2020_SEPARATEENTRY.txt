Developer log entry for today: view it here (developer log day 421)

I had an extremely laid back update today, with nothing but documentation changes. I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do today, and I also had horrible time management, getting up at 8:00 am, but not getting to work until after 3:00 pm. I was doing other things, like tutoring my little brother with math, and just relaxing.
