Developer log entry for today: view it here (developer log day 469)
Developer log weekly summary: view it here (developer log week 67)

I had very little time for development today, as I allocated a lot of time to other projects. Today, I continued the separate documentation project, now going for weekly entries. I got 10 done today, I will try to do 20 tomorrow, if I have the time. I have been putting tons of time into another project, it has been updated on a daily basis for 12 days now. I won't drop support for SNU over this, but I almost have this project in a fully working state.
