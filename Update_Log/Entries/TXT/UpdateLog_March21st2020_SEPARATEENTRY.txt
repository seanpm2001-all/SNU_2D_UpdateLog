Wish Sean a (late) happy 19th birthday

Today is my 19th birthday. Today, I worked on getting as much done as possible before 3:00 pm so that I could celebrate my birthday without having to think about work as much. I made a little bit of an extended update today in the nearly 2 hours I had, including articles on typography, the usual documentation, an ideaboard update, and work on a new online school system, as there aren't any good online school programs, and we need something other than Google classroom.

I had a decent day with development today. I recently came up with more ideas that I can work with, and I hope to begin improving site development soon. I finally have a good schedule (at least today) and I may become more productive. I also finally found a good Linux laptop, and I might get it as a late birthday present. It took a year of monthly searches, but I think this might be the one. Site development may slow down during the copy over process.
