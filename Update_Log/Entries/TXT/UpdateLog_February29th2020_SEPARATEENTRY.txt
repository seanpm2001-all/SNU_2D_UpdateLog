Developer log entry for today: view it here (developer log day 394)

I worked on another update today, and had a little more time to do so. My friend Michael wasn't available today, so I didn't go see him. Today, I am working with a new goal, which is to make separate update log and developer log entries again. This time, I feel that I can keep up with it.
