Developer log entry for today: view it here (developer log day 411)

I continued work on language features again today. I have failed to bring this up for a while now, but SNU is starting to get really cluttered, and more difficult to work with. I started out with a short todo list in December of 2019, and now I have 3 ToDo lists (they are comments in the source code of the update log) they started small, but now it is an extra 8+ kilobytes and over 200 lines a day, and the majority of it is going unfulfilled. I am working on the issue now, and will try to find a way to better sort this info.

Today I worked on the new translation service again, along with an HTML test reference page of the ISO language codes. I also did the usual documentation changes, and got a little done. Development is a little slow at the moment, I am working out my schedule, and working on many projects. I have 6 weeks off from school now due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and I just solved a technical issue that altered my performance at school. Today was a decent day for development, but I just need more to do.
