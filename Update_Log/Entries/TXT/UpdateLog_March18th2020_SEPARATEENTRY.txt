I had more time today, but I was also halfway functional again as well. Today, along with documentation and work on another translation tool update, I made my first use of the tel: attribute, and created a functional suicide prevention center. If the hotline numbers just don't work for people, there is built-in info on why you shouldn't kill yourself, based on personal experience.

Today was another simple update day. I am slowly working on adding new features, at the moment I am putting some time into a translation service on a daily basis. I also am going to start online classes soon, once the links are fixed and don't lead to a 404 page. Site development is a little slow at the moment, and I have managed to keep development going on a daily basis for 3 months now. Today was a decent day for development.
