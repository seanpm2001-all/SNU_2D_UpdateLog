Developer log entry for today: view it here (developer log day 404)

I started school again today, and I made an update plan for today. Today, I will be updating older articles (March 6th 2020) as I am now converting update log and developer log articles in 4 new formats (DOC, DOCX, UOT, RTF) my CPU usage is still an issue, but it isn't as bad at school.

Along with documentation and exported files, today I worked on pages for new settings for video players, and the instant functionality of things. I also began work on a new disease research center, which can be used to research and learn about current and older diseases, including the COVID-19 (CoronaVirus) pandemic.
