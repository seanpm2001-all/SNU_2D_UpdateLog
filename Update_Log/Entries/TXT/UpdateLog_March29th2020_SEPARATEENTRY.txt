Developer log entry for today: view it here (developer log day 424)

I created a smaller update today. Originally, I planned on updating CardStack today, but I really didn't feel up to it, and I didn't have the time either. I worked on a new setting today for the digital cursor, and also created a news center with 1 starter article. I also did documenttion, but tht is pretty much it for the day. I hope tomorrow can go better, but I also have more online schoolwork starting either tomorrow, or some other time this week. My motivation for this project has been down for a while, but I will not abandon it at this point.

The SNU Update log has become massively bloated, and I have an experimental idea for a fix to the issue, which is to create a separate update log with all comments over 50 bytes removed, since I can't remove them from the current version due to a rule I made. The update log is over 3 megabytes in size now, and it has been lagging more and more lately. Today was a short day for development.
